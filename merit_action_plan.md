# Merit Enhancement Action Plan

This document outlines the action plan for elevating the project from Pass to Merit level.

## 1. Gap Analysis:

Based on the previous analysis, here are the gaps between the current project and the Merit criteria:

*   **1.1 Design and build a real-world full stack MVC e-commerce application with a Front-End: that is easy to navigate and allows the user to find information and resources intuitively:** The home page and base template need improvement to be more user-friendly and intuitive.
*   **1.2 Produce a fully robust codebase:** The views, middleware, and forms need better error handling and validation.
*   **1.3 All data (CRUD) actions are immediately reflected in the user interface:** This needs to be verified throughout the application.
*   **1.4 Follow a thorough manual and/or automated test approach (for JavaScript and/or Python), demonstrated in the git commits:** The project is currently lacking tests.
*   **1.5 Configure the project efficiently through well-kept Procfile, requirements.txt file, settings files, keep the data store configuration in a single location where it can be changed easily:** This is mostly satisfied, but the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting needs to be improved.
*   **1.6 Fully describe the data schema in the project README file:** The project README file needs to be updated to include a description of the data schema.
*   **1.7 Use version control software effectively to provide a record of the development process:** This is assumed to be in place, but the commit messages should be clear and informative.
*   **2.1 The user has full control of their interaction with the application:** This needs to be verified throughout the application.
*   **2.2 The site's purpose is immediately evident to a new user:** The home page needs to be improved to make the site's purpose more clear.
*   **2.3 The site provides a good solution to the user’s demands and expectations:** This needs to be verified through user testing or feedback.
*   **3.1 Control access to your sitemap via a robots.txt file:** The project is missing a robots.txt file.
*   **3.2 All sitemap links are canonical:** This needs to be verified.
*   **3.3 Use descriptive metadata for SEO that accurately reflect the site’s purpose:** The project needs better metadata for SEO.
*   **4.1 Users only have access to intended views and functionality:** This needs to be verified throughout the application.
*   **5.1 Document the primary marketing strategy behind the application:** The project README file needs to document the primary marketing strategy.
*   **6.1 The solution has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences):** The project should have a clear purpose and target audience.
