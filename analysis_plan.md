# Project Analysis Plan

This document outlines the plan for analyzing the e-commerce website development project and identifying areas for improvement for each grade level (Pass, Merit, and Distinction).

## Plan

1.  **Analyze the entire project directory structure:** Examine all files and subdirectories in the project to understand the project's structure, functionality, and implementation. This will involve looking at models, views, templates, forms, URLs, static files, configuration files, documentation, and resources.
2.  **Assess against Pass criteria:** Based on the file analysis, determine which Pass criteria have been met and which are missing or incomplete.
3.  **Assess against Merit criteria:** Similarly, assess the project against the Merit criteria, identifying areas where the project falls short.
4.  **Assess against Distinction criteria:** Evaluate the project against the Distinction criteria, focusing on aspects like UX design, code quality, testing, and security.
5.  **Identify gaps and areas for improvement:** For each grade level, summarize the gaps and areas for improvement, providing specific recommendations for the user to address them.
6.  **Structure the analysis:** Organize the analysis according to the grading criteria, with clear actionable recommendations for each achievement level (Pass, Merit, and Distinction).
