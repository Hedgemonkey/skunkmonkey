## 🎯 Project Goals

The goal of **SkunkMonkey** is to build a **fully functional, scalable
e-commerce platform** where users can **browse**, **search**, **purchase**, and
**manage orders** efficiently. The platform will feature **user authentication,
product browsing, shopping cart functionality, and an admin management system**.

This project is being built using **Django, PostgreSQL, Vite, and Bootstrap**,
with an emphasis on **security, performance, and a mobile-friendly UI**. The
frontend assets are managed through **Vite**, providing faster build times and
an improved development experience.

## 🗄️ Database Schema & Migration Strategy

### 🔹 Database Schema Overview

The database is designed using **PostgreSQL** and follows Django's **ORM**
structure. Below is an overview of how data is structured. Note that this
diagram does not represent all tables in the database. Additional tables manage
user authentication, sessions, and social accounts.

```text
+--------------------+         +--------------------+

### 🔹 Strategy for Schema Changes in Production

Managing **schema changes** in a production environment requires careful planning
to **minimize downtime** and **prevent data loss**. Below is the strategy we
follow:

#### **1️⃣ Plan & Assess the Change**

- Identify **which tables and fields** will be modified.
- Determine **dependencies & constraints** (e.g., foreign keys).
- Choose an **appropriate migration strategy** (Zero-Downtime, Rolling Migration,
  etc.).

#### **2️⃣ Use Django Migrations**

All schema changes are managed through Django's built-in migration framework:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

- Always **review** the generated migration file before applying it.
- Test migrations in a **staging environment** before running them in production.

#### **3️⃣ Ensure Safe Deployment**

**For small changes** (adding new columns):

- **Deploy application changes first** before running the migration.
- Set **default values** for new columns to avoid breaking queries.

**For large changes** (removing columns, renaming tables):

- Use a **rolling migration**:
  - Create a **new table** with the updated structure.
  - Gradually **migrate data**.
  - Update the **application to use the new table**.
  - Drop the old table once migration is complete.

#### **4️⃣ Backup Before Running Migrations**

Before applying schema changes, always **backup the database**:

```bash
pg_dump -U myuser -h mydbhost -d mydatabase -f backup.sql
```

- In case of failure, **restore the backup**:

```bash
psql -U myuser -h mydbhost -d mydatabase -f backup.sql
```

#### **5️⃣ Apply Migrations in Production**

Once the migration is tested and confirmed:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

- Use `--fake-initial` if migrations were manually applied before:

```bash
python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
```

#### **6️⃣ Monitor & Rollback if Needed**

- Monitor **database logs** and check for errors.
- If needed, **rollback the migration**:

```bash
python manage.py migrate myapp 000x_previous_migration
```

- Keep rollback **scripts ready** for critical changes.

## 📜 Database Change Log

All schema changes are documented in a structured manner for tracking purposes.

### 🔹 Template for Logging Database Changes

Each change is logged in `DATABASE_CHANGELOG.md` to keep track of modifications.

### **Production Deployment**

This project will be deployed to a **production server** using **one of the
following platforms**:

- **Heroku**
- **AWS EC2**
- **DigitalOcean**
- **Railway.app**

#### **Planned Deployment Process**

1. **Build Frontend Assets**:
   - Run `npm run build` to compile and optimize static assets with Vite.
   - The built assets will be placed in the `static` directory for Django to
     serve.

2. **Containerization (Optional)**:
   - A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` may be used for easy deployment.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - GitHub Actions will be set up for automated testing and deployment.
   - Frontend assets will be built as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Sensitive settings (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials) will be
     stored in the **Heroku Config Vars** or an `.env` file in the server.
   - Frontend environment variables will be handled through Vite's env
     configuration.

5. **PostgreSQL Database**:
   - A managed **PostgreSQL database** will be used for scalability.
