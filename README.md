## 🗄️ Database Schema & Migration Strategy

### 🔹 Database Schema Overview  
The database is designed using **PostgreSQL** and follows Django’s **ORM** structure. Below is an overview of how data is structured:

```plaintext
+--------------------+         +--------------------+
|     Category       |         |      Product       |
+--------------------+         +--------------------+
| id (PK)            |         | id (PK)            |
| name               |         | name               |
| slug               |         | description        |
+--------------------+         | price              |
                               | category_id (FK)   |
                               | stock_quantity     |
                               | image              |
                               | created_at         |
                               | updated_at         |
                               | slug               |
                               +--------------------+
                                        |
                                        | 1:M
                                        v
+--------------------+         +--------------------+
|      Review        |         |   InventoryLog     |
+--------------------+         +--------------------+
| id (PK)            |         | id (PK)            |
| product_id (FK)    |         | product_id (FK)    |
| user_id (FK)       |         | change             |
| rating             |         | reason             |
| comment            |         | created_at         |
| created_at         |         +--------------------+
+--------------------+

```

Relationships:
- `Category` ↔️ `Product`: One-to-Many (a category can have many products)  
- `Product` ↔️ `Review`: One-to-Many (a product can have many reviews)  
- `Product` ↔️ `InventoryLog`: One-to-Many (tracks stock changes over time)  
- `Review` ↔️ `User`: Many-to-One (a user can leave many reviews)  

The database consists of relational tables that store information about users, products, and orders. **Django's ORM** is used to interact with the database efficiently.

### 🔹 Strategy for Schema Changes in Production  
Managing **schema changes** in a production environment requires careful planning to **minimize downtime** and **prevent data loss**. Below is the strategy we follow:

#### **1️⃣ Plan & Assess the Change**
- Identify **which tables and fields** will be modified.
- Determine **dependencies & constraints** (e.g., foreign keys).
- Choose an **appropriate migration strategy** (Zero-Downtime, Rolling Migration, etc.).

#### **2️⃣ Use Django Migrations**
All schema changes are managed through Django’s built-in migration framework:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
- Always **review** the generated migration file before applying it.
- Test migrations in a **staging environment** before running them in production.

#### **3️⃣ Ensure Safe Deployment**
**For small changes** (adding new columns):  
- **Deploy application changes first** before running the migration.
- Set **default values** for new columns to avoid breaking queries.

**For large changes** (removing columns, renaming tables):  
- Use a **rolling migration**:
  - Create a **new table** with the updated structure.
  - Gradually **migrate data**.
  - Update the **application to use the new table**.
  - Drop the old table once migration is complete.

#### **4️⃣ Backup Before Running Migrations**
Before applying schema changes, always **backup the database**:
```sh
pg_dump -U myuser -h mydbhost -d mydatabase -f backup.sql
```
- In case of failure, **restore the backup**:
  ```sh
  psql -U myuser -h mydbhost -d mydatabase -f backup.sql
  ```

#### **5️⃣ Apply Migrations in Production**
Once the migration is tested and confirmed:
```sh
python manage.py migrate
```
- Use `--fake-initial` if migrations were manually applied before:
  ```sh
  python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
  ```

#### **6️⃣ Monitor & Rollback if Needed**
- Monitor **database logs** and check for errors.
- If needed, **rollback the migration**:
  ```sh
  python manage.py migrate myapp 000x_previous_migration
  ```
- Keep rollback **scripts ready** for critical changes.

## 📜 Database Change Log
All schema changes are documented in a structured manner for tracking purposes.

### 🔹 Template for Logging Database Changes
Each change is logged in `DATABASE_CHANGELOG.md` to keep track of modifications.

```
# 🛠️ Database Change Log

## 📅 [YYYY-MM-DD] - Migration 00XX_auto
### 📝 Summary:
- Added `new_field` to `users` table.
- Renamed `old_column` in `orders` table.
- Created new `payments` table.

### 🔄 Migration Commands:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

### 🔄 Rollback Commands:
python manage.py migrate myapp 000x_previous_migration

### 🛠️ Reason for Change:
> The changes were introduced to improve scalability and add support for new features.

### 🔍 Impact & Dependencies:
- This affects **User Authentication** and **Order Processing** modules.
- Old API endpoints should be **deprecated** by next release.
```

## 🔍 Querying Migration History
To check applied migrations in PostgreSQL:
```
SELECT * FROM django_migrations ORDER BY applied DESC;
```

To check **last migration applied**:
```
python manage.py showmigrations myapp
```

[Back to top](#contents)

---

## 🔄 Version Control & Documentation
- All migration files are **version-controlled** in Git.
- Commit messages follow this format:
  ```
  [DB] Added new payments table & updated user schema (#245)
  ```
- Release tags are used for **tracking major schema changes**:
  ```
  git tag -a v1.5.0 -m "Database migration for payments table"
  git push origin v1.5.0
  ```

## ✅ Best Practices for Database Changes
✔ Always **plan and test** schema changes in a **staging environment**.  
✔ Use **Django migrations** instead of manual SQL changes.  
✔ Follow **zero-downtime or rolling migrations** for production databases.  
✔ Maintain a **backup before applying any changes**.  
✔ Keep detailed **logs & rollback strategies** for each migration.
