## üèóÔ∏è User Experience

### üìå Epics

This project follows an **Agile development workflow**, structured around **GitHub KanBan**. Below are the main **epics**, each representing a key area of the project:

- **[Initialization & Django Setup](#)**
- **[User Registration & Authentication](#)**
- **[Product Browsing & Search](#)**
- **[Shopping Cart & Checkout](#)**
- **[Admin & Order Management](#)**
- **[UI/UX Design](#)**
- **[Marketing & SEO](#)**
